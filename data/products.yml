      name: NEAT Genetic Algorithm
      description: |
        NEAT is a genetic algorithm that evolves neural networks. It is a method for evolving arbitrary neural networks. This means neuroevolution can be applied to any task that has a well-defined measure of success, as long as a training set of examples can be generated. NEAT is also quite effective at evolving neural networks with multiple outputs, which can solve problems that other neuroevolution techniques cannot.

      name: Environment
      description: The environment is a 2D world with a population of creatures. Each creature has a neural network that controls its movement. The creatures are rewarded for moving towards food. The neural network is given information about the creature's environment, such as the direction and distance to food. The creatures are also rewarded for staying alive, which is done by giving them a small bonus each time step.

      name: Emergent Behavior
      description: Emergent behavior is behavior of a system that does not depend on its individual parts, but on their relationships to one another. The creatures in this simulation are not explicitly programmed to move towards food. Instead, they learn to do so through the process of natural selection. This is an example of emergent behavior.

      name: Natural Selection
      description: Natural selection is the process by which organisms with favorable traits survive and reproduce at a greater rate than those without such traits. In this simulation, the creatures with neural networks that are better at moving towards food are more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, this leads to the evolution of neural networks that are good at moving towards food.
    - name: Permanent simulation coming soon!
      cSlug: c2
      description: Currently, the simulation is not permanent. The simulation will restart after you close the page. However, I am working on optimizing the simulation so that it can run indefinitely. This will allow for more interesting behaviors to emerge in the long term.
